You Asked for It, We Delivered — Shimano 7 Speed. The EB7 Plus is a true upgrade to its predecessor in every sense of the word. We engineered this electric commuter bike with the versatile Shimano 7-speed SIS gear system for true multi-gear efficiency. It’s the light, precise and consistent shifting riders expect from a bike equipped with Shimano gears. And the EB7 Plus delivers. A quick-shift thumb button lets you easily shift up to higher gears. For more precise shifting, use the STI levers and coast with confidence.
